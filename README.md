# Python For Data Analysis - Final Project

By ROUSSELLE Jean-Baptiste and NICOLAS Antonin

## The dataset and the task

We used the following dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand  
It shows the number of rented bikes in Seoul per hour with several parameters (season, rainfall, temperature...).  
We figured that our task was to predict the demand of bikes with all the parameters that we had.

## Conclusion

We obtained a model with approximately 80% of accuracy. This is not high enough for our model to be entirely reliable. To upgrade it, we could try to add some variables that we removed in the cleaning process. Or we could remove more variables.
