# Python For Data Analysis - Final Project

By ROUSSELLE Jean-Baptiste and NICOLAS Antonin

## The dataset and the task

We used the following dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand  
It shows the number of rented bikes in Seoul per hour with several parameters (season, rainfall, temperature...).  
We figured that our task was to predict the demand of bikes with all the parameters that we had.

## Conclusion

We obtained a model with 76% of accuracy. This means that 3 predictions out of 4 will be pretty close from the reality. This is not high enough for our model to be reliable. To upgrade it, we could try to add some variables that we removed in the cleaning process. Or we could remove more variables.
